Through one of the obscurest quarters of London, and among haunts little loved by the gentlemen of the police, a man evidently of the lowest orders was wending his solitary way."

The importance of making biodiversity data openly available to all countries and individuals is underscored by various international agreements."

The Participant BIF has the overall objective of promoting, coordinating and facilitating the mobilisation and use of biodiversity data among all the relevant stakeholders within the Participant’s domain, primarily to help address the Participant’s biodiversity information needs and priorities.  The Participant BIF should be the main mechanism by which the GBIF Participant coordinates with, contributes to and benefits from the central services, infrastructure, and capacity provided by GBIF as a globally decentralised initiative.  A Participant BIF includes both physical infrastructure and human resources.  Typically a Participant BIF encourages and supports the activities of the Participant’s data publishers to both contribute and use GBIF-served data, provides information technology (IT) infrastructure and expertise for GBIF-related activities, and functions as an information gateway among Participants, other stakeholders, and the GBIF Secretariat."
