== Paragraph 10
ASSOCIATION AND DISASSOCIATION OF PARTICIPANTS

1. Association of Participants
Association with GBIF is open to any country, economy, inter-governmental,
international organisation or organisation with an international scope or to an entity
designated by them as described in Paragraph 1.2. Such association becomes effective
upon signature of this MOU.

2. Participant Status
(a) A country that has signed the MOU becomes a Voting Participant on the Governing
Board by deciding to make a Basic Financial Contribution and making the financial
arrangement negotiated with the GBIF Secretariat, as described in Paragraph
6.4(c). This arrangement sets out the Voting Participantâ€™s financial contribution
calculated on the basis of the approved Guidelines for calculating Basic Financial
Contributions (See 4.6(g)) and the period for which the arrangement is valid.
(b) In order to retain voting rights a Voting Participant is requested to make its
financial contribution each year within the first three months of the GBIF financial
year, unless the Executive Committee has approved a later payment arrangement
for the financial year.
The voting rights of a Voting Participant that is more than one financial year behind
paying its basic financial contribution in accordance with the financial arrangement
will be suspended until it has made all outstanding financial contributions.

3. Disassociation of Participants
(a) Any Participant may disassociate itself from this MOU by advising the Governing
Board in writing of its intention to do so and of the effective date of
disassociation.
(b) In the event of disassociation of a Voting Participant, the Governing Board may
decide by consensus to adjust the Work Programme and the Budget to take
account of such disassociation or, again by consensus, may decide to adjust the
contributions of Participants to the Budget in accordance with the approved
Guidelines for calculating Basic Financial Contribution (See 4.6(g)).
