Paragraph 3
OBJECTIVES

1. Purpose
The purpose of GBIF is to promote, co-ordinate, design, enable and implement the
compilation, linking, standardisation, digitisation and global dissemination and use
of the world’s biodiversity data, within an appropriate framework for property
rights and due attribution. GBIF works in close co-operation with established
programmes and organisations that compile maintain and use biological information
resources. The Participants, working through GBIF, establish and support a
distributed information system that enables users to access and utilise considerable
quantities of existing and new biodiversity data.

2. Goals of GBIF
It is the intention of the Participants that GBIF:
(a) be shared and distributed, while encouraging co-operation and coherence;
(b) be global in scale, though implemented nationally and regionally;
(c) be accessible by individuals anywhere in the world, offering potential benefits
to all, while being funded primarily by those that have the greatest financial
capabilities;
(d) promote standards and software tools designed to facilitate their adaptation
into multiple languages, character sets and computer encodings;
(e) serve to disseminate technological capacity by drawing on and making widely
available scientific and technical information; and
(f) make biodiversity data universally available, while fully acknowledging the
contribution made by those gathering and publishing these data.

3. Involvement of the Participants
Each Participant signing this MOU should seek to:
(a) participate actively in the formulation and implementation of the GBIF Strategic
Plan and the Work Programme, both cooperatively in the Governing Board and
through development of national policies as appropriate;
(b) share biodiversity data through GBIF under a common set of technical standards
and within an intellectual property rights framework (such as that described in
Paragraph 8);
(c) form a Participant Biodiversity Information Facility (with a Node or network of
Nodes), to organise and/or provide access to biodiversity data and metadata,
standards, software tools or other services to enhance the GBIF network. If an
‘Other Associate Participants’ as defined in 4.2 b(v) - cannot share data and
establish a BIF, the Participant may in its petition to become a GBIF Participant
outline in what way it intends to be relevant and actively contribute to the
achievements of GBIF’s overall purpose and some of the goals of GBIF (See 3.1
and 3.2);
(d) secure its national intellectual, technological and data mobilisation investments
as a Participant in GBIF;
(e) as appropriate, make other investments in biodiversity information
infrastructure in support of the GBIF mission and national, regional and 
6
international needs, as well as help to co-ordinate and harmonise the
biodiversity informatics programmes of the Participants, and
(f) as appropriate, contribute to training and capacity development for promoting
global access to biodiversity data, including implementing specific programs to
enhance the biodiversity informatics capacity and technical skills base of
developing countries.

4. Co-operation and Co-ordination
The Participants intend to encourage co-operation amongst themselves in the
implementation of GBIF and in the development of joint work programmes in areas
of mutual interest with the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity and
other appropriate bodies and initiatives to avoid duplication and to benefit from
existing resources and expertise.
